//! Provides the fundamental units of computation in a Neural Network.
//!
//! These layers provide different type of operations to the data Blobs
//! that flow through them.
//! The operations provided by the layers can be
//! roughly grouped into four categories:
//!
//! * [__Activation__][mod_activation]</br>
//! Activation Layers provide element-wise operations and produce one top Blob
//! of the same size as the bottom Blob.
//! It can be seen as a synonym to nonlinear [Activation Functions][2].
//!
//! * [__Common__][mod_common]</br>
//! Common Layers can differ in their connectivity and behavior and are
//! typically all network layer
//! types which are not covered by activation or loss layers.
//! Examples would be fully connected
//! layers, covolutional layers, pooling layers, etc.
//!
//! * [__Loss__][mod_loss]</br>
//! Loss Layers compare an output to a target value and assign cost to
//! minimize. Loss Layers are often the last layer in a [Network][1].
//!
//! * [__Utility__][mod_utility]</br>
//! Utility Layers provide all kind of helpful functionality, which might not
//! be directly related
//! to machine learning and neural nets. This could be operations for
//! normalizing,
//! restructuring or transforming information, log and debug behavior or data
//! access.
//! Utility Layers follow the general behavior of a layer, like the other types
//! do.
//!
//! For more information about how these layers work together, see the
//! documentation for the general [Layer module][3].
